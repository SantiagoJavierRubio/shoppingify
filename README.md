## Overview

![screenshot](https://github.com/SantiagoJavierRubio/shoppingify/blob/master/Screen%20Shot%202022-01-26%20at%2013.57.31.png)


- Demo available at https://shoppingify-sjr.netlify.app/ , just register with your email, validate it and you're ready to go.
- This challenge took me a little longer than previous ones (even longer than I expected), partly because I took it that way in order to learn nwe technologies and also because the hollidays and vacation days.
- Learned a lot of Redux and redux-saga from scratch.
- Challenged myself to use a mysql database for this challenge, it was somewhat challenging because I've never used it in an express server.
- I also implemented (for the first time in express) the mailing system for validations using nodemailer.
- Finally, I learned some session and session storage handling for the back-end, I hope to use that knowdelege to upgrade my log and register with other services.
